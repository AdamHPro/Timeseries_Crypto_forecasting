# Timeseries_Cryptos_forecasting

Building a timeseries forecasting model to predict cryptocurrency prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

The goal is to know the best day in a month to buy a cryptocurrency in order to maximize profit.

The project have a dataset of a crypto as an input, the period of time analyse, and the model will output the best day to buy the crypto in order to maximize profit in that window of time.
